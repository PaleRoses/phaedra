## Installing on FreeBSD

Phaedra is available [via the ports system](https://www.freshports.org/x11/phaedra/).

The most common FreeBSD architectures have pre-built binaries which you can install via:

```console
$ pkg install phaedra
```

The version available in ports is not directly managed by the release
automation of the Phaedra project and may lag behind the latest release.  If
you need to run a newer version, then the [build from source](source.md)
instructions also apply to FreeBSD.
